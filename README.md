# Generic Discord Rich Presence
Discord Rich Presence everywhere!

## Features
 * Attention status based on game window focus
 * Second-precision playtime
 * Politely bows out when another Rich Presence application is covering your game
 * Steam profile scraping to provide more details for games launched through Steam (requires connecting your Steam account and making your playing status public; the connection itself can stay hidden)

## Installation
Clone the repo down to your plugins folder, and then just
```
npm rptime
```
...and restart your client.
